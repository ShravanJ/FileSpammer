The Java based disk stress test

We are pretty sure if you leave this open for long enough you should be able to stress test your hard drive. Please note that we still do not know the long term consequences of running this program for extended periods of time and what effects it may have on your hard drive and/or filesystem. 

Effectiveness
=============
We are yet to evaluate how effective this program actually is in stress testing a hard drive. We will be conducting tests on OS X, Windows, and Linux based machines with the HFS+, NTFS, and ext4fs filesystems respectively to see how this program actually affects the stress on a hard disk.
